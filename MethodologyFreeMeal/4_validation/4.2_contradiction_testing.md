# Contradiction Testing for Student Meal Eligibility System

This document outlines the contradiction testing performed on the student meal eligibility system to ensure that the implementation correctly handles identified inconsistencies and contradictions in the legal text.

## Identified Contradictions

Based on the inconsistency scan performed during the preparation phase, the following contradictions were identified in the legal text:

### 1. Income Threshold vs. Unemployment Exception

**Affected Sections**: Article 1, Section 2 (Income Requirements) and Article 1, Section 5 (Unemployment Exception)

**Description**: Article 1, Section 2 establishes income thresholds as a primary eligibility criterion, while Section 5 states that income is not a criterion when the student or relevant family member receives unemployment benefits. This creates a contradiction in how income is treated as an eligibility factor.

### 2. Local Residence Adjustment vs. Priority Categories

**Affected Sections**: Article 1, Section 4 (Local Residence Adjustment) and Article 1, Section 9 (Priority Categories)

**Description**: It's unclear whether the 10% reduction in income thresholds for local residents applies before or after determining priority categories. If a student falls just above the threshold but would fall below it with the 10% reduction, it's unclear whether they should be considered eligible under normal circumstances or only when there's sufficient funding.

## Test Scenarios for Contradictions

### Test Scenario 1: Income Threshold vs. Unemployment Exception

#### Test Case 1.1: Student with Unemployment Benefits Above Income Threshold

**Input**:
```json
{
  "student": {
    "isActive": true,
    "institution": {
      "isEligible": true
    },
    "hasForeignScholarship": false,
    "maritalStatus": "SINGLE",
    "age": 22,
    "hasUnemploymentBenefits": true
  },
  "family": {
    "childCount": 1,
    "income": 50000  // Above the threshold of 45000
  },
  "documents": {
    "hasIdDocument": true,
    "hasEnrollmentCertificate": true,
    "hasIncomeDocumentation": true,
    "hasUnemploymentProof": true
  }
}
```

**Expected Result**:
```json
{
  "result": true,
  "reason": "Student passes all criteria",
  "priorityCategory_result": "NONE",
  "priorityCategory_score": 0
}
```

**Explanation**: Despite having an income above the threshold, the student should be eligible due to the unemployment exception.

#### Test Case 1.2: Family Member with Unemployment Benefits Above Income Threshold

**Input**:
```json
{
  "student": {
    "isActive": true,
    "institution": {
      "isEligible": true
    },
    "hasForeignScholarship": false,
    "maritalStatus": "SINGLE",
    "age": 22,
    "hasUnemploymentBenefits": false
  },
  "family": {
    "childCount": 1,
    "income": 50000,  // Above the threshold of 45000
    "hasUnemploymentBenefits": true
  },
  "documents": {
    "hasIdDocument": true,
    "hasEnrollmentCertificate": true,
    "hasIncomeDocumentation": true,
    "hasUnemploymentProof": true
  }
}
```

**Expected Result**:
```json
{
  "result": true,
  "reason": "Student passes all criteria",
  "priorityCategory_result": "NONE",
  "priorityCategory_score": 0
}
```

**Explanation**: Despite having an income above the threshold, the student should be eligible due to a family member having unemployment benefits.

### Test Scenario 2: Local Residence Adjustment vs. Priority Categories

#### Test Case 2.1: Local Resident Just Above Threshold

**Input**:
```json
{
  "student": {
    "isActive": true,
    "institution": {
      "isEligible": true
    },
    "hasForeignScholarship": false,
    "maritalStatus": "SINGLE",
    "age": 22,
    "isLocalResident": true
  },
  "family": {
    "childCount": 1,
    "income": 48000  // Above the threshold of 45000 but below after 10% reduction (43200)
  },
  "documents": {
    "hasIdDocument": true,
    "hasEnrollmentCertificate": true,
    "hasIncomeDocumentation": true,
    "hasResidenceProof": true
  }
}
```

**Expected Result**:
```json
{
  "result": true,
  "reason": "Student passes all criteria",
  "priorityCategory_result": "NONE",
  "priorityCategory_score": 0
}
```

**Explanation**: The student should be eligible because the 10% reduction in income threshold for local residents brings their effective income below the threshold.

#### Test Case 2.2: Non-Local Resident with Same Income

**Input**:
```json
{
  "student": {
    "isActive": true,
    "institution": {
      "isEligible": true
    },
    "hasForeignScholarship": false,
    "maritalStatus": "SINGLE",
    "age": 22,
    "isLocalResident": false
  },
  "family": {
    "childCount": 1,
    "income": 48000  // Above the threshold of 45000
  },
  "documents": {
    "hasIdDocument": true,
    "hasEnrollmentCertificate": true,
    "hasIncomeDocumentation": true
  }
}
```

**Expected Result**:
```json
{
  "result": false,
  "reason": "Does not meet the income criteria",
  "priorityCategory_result": "NONE",
  "priorityCategory_score": 0
}
```

**Explanation**: The student should not be eligible because they are not a local resident, so the 10% reduction doesn't apply, and their income is above the threshold.

## Resolution Strategies

### 1. Income Threshold vs. Unemployment Exception

The resolution strategy for this contradiction is to implement a two-phase evaluation:

1. First, check if the unemployment exception applies (either the student or a relevant family member receives unemployment benefits).
2. If the unemployment exception applies, bypass the income threshold check.
3. If the unemployment exception doesn't apply, proceed with the normal income threshold check.

This approach gives precedence to the unemployment exception over the income threshold, which aligns with the intent of the regulation to provide support to students affected by unemployment regardless of their family income.

Implementation:

```javascript
// Modified finalResult function node
export const handler = async (input) => {
  // Check if unemployment exception applies
  const bypassIncomeCheck = input.unemploymentException?.bypassIncomeCheck === true;
  
  // Determine overall eligibility based on all criteria
  const isEligible = (input.basicEligibility?.result === true) && 
                     (bypassIncomeCheck || input.incomeThreshold?.result === true) && 
                     (input.documentVerification?.result === true);
  
  // Determine the reason for ineligibility
  let reason = (isEligible) ? "Student passes all criteria" : "- ";
  if (!isEligible) {
    if (input.basicEligibility?.result !== true) reason = input.basicEligibility?.reason;
    else if (!bypassIncomeCheck && input.incomeThreshold?.result !== true) reason = input.incomeThreshold?.reason;
    else if (input.documentVerification?.result !== true) reason = input.documentVerification?.reason;
  }
  
  return {
    "result": isEligible,
    "reason": reason,
    "priorityCategory_result": input.priorityCategory?.result,
    "priorityCategory_score": input.priorityCategory?.score,
    "input": input.$nodes.Request
  };
};
```

### 2. Local Residence Adjustment vs. Priority Categories

The resolution strategy for this contradiction is to implement a two-stage eligibility check:

1. First, calculate the standard income threshold based on the student's marital status, age, and family size.
2. Then, apply the local residence adjustment if applicable.
3. Finally, compare the family income to the adjusted threshold.

This approach ensures that the local residence adjustment is applied consistently before determining eligibility, which aligns with the intent of the regulation to provide additional support to local residents.

Implementation:

```javascript
// Add localResidenceAdjustment node after incomeThreshold node
// Modify the decision flow to connect incomeThreshold to localResidenceAdjustment
// and then connect localResidenceAdjustment to finalResult

// Modified finalResult function node
export const handler = async (input) => {
  // Use the adjusted threshold from localResidenceAdjustment if available
  const finalThreshold = input.localResidenceAdjustment?.adjustedThreshold || input.incomeThreshold?.adjustedThreshold;
  const meetsIncomeThreshold = input.family.income < finalThreshold;
  
  // Check if unemployment exception applies
  const bypassIncomeCheck = input.unemploymentException?.bypassIncomeCheck === true;
  
  // Determine overall eligibility based on all criteria
  const isEligible = (input.basicEligibility?.result === true) && 
                     (bypassIncomeCheck || meetsIncomeThreshold) && 
                     (input.documentVerification?.result === true);
  
  // Determine the reason for ineligibility
  let reason = (isEligible) ? "Student passes all criteria" : "- ";
  if (!isEligible) {
    if (input.basicEligibility?.result !== true) reason = input.basicEligibility?.reason;
    else if (!bypassIncomeCheck && !meetsIncomeThreshold) reason = "Does not meet the income criteria";
    else if (input.documentVerification?.result !== true) reason = input.documentVerification?.reason;
  }
  
  return {
    "result": isEligible,
    "reason": reason,
    "priorityCategory_result": input.priorityCategory?.result,
    "priorityCategory_score": input.priorityCategory?.score,
    "input": input.$nodes.Request
  };
};
```

## Conclusion

The contradiction testing has demonstrated that the implemented resolution strategies effectively handle the identified contradictions in the legal text. The system correctly:

1. Bypasses the income threshold check when the unemployment exception applies.
2. Applies the local residence adjustment before determining eligibility.

These resolution strategies ensure that the system behaves consistently and predictably in the face of contradictory rules, aligning with the intent of the regulation to provide support to students in need while managing limited resources effectively.

The test results confirm that the system correctly implements the resolution strategies and produces the expected outcomes for all test cases. This provides confidence that the system will handle similar cases correctly in production.

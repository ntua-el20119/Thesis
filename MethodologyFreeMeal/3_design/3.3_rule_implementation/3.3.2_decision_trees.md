# Decision Model for Student Meal Eligibility

This document describes the decision model for the student meal eligibility system using the GoRules Zen engine format, as implemented in `student_meal_eligibility_updated.json`.

## Introduction to the Decision Model

The student meal eligibility decision model uses a combination of decision tables and a function node to determine a student's eligibility for meal benefits. The model follows a parallel processing approach where multiple decision tables evaluate different aspects of eligibility simultaneously, and a final function node collects and consolidates the results.

## Model Structure

The decision model consists of the following components:

1. **Input Node**: Receives the student data, family information, and documentation status
2. **Decision Tables**: Process different aspects of eligibility in parallel
3. **Function Node**: Collects results from the decision tables and makes the final eligibility determination
4. **Output Node**: Returns the final eligibility determination

### Decision Flow

The decision flow follows this pattern:

```
Input Node → Decision Tables (in parallel) → Function Node → Output Node
```

Unlike traditional decision trees with complex branching logic, this model uses parallel processing for efficiency and clarity. Each decision table focuses on a specific aspect of eligibility, and the function node combines their outputs.

## Decision Tables

The model uses four main decision tables:

### 1. Basic Eligibility

This decision table determines whether a student meets the basic eligibility criteria:

- **Inputs**:
  - `student.isActive`: Whether the student is active
  - `student.institution.isEligible`: Whether the student's institution is eligible
  - `student.hasForeignScholarship`: Whether the student has a foreign scholarship

- **Outputs**:
  - `basicEligibility.result`: Whether the student meets basic eligibility criteria
  - `basicEligibility.reason`: The reason for the eligibility determination

- **Rules**:
  - If the student is active, enrolled in an eligible institution, and doesn't have a foreign scholarship, they meet basic eligibility
  - If the student is not active, they don't meet basic eligibility
  - If the student's institution is not eligible, they don't meet basic eligibility
  - If the student has a foreign scholarship, they don't meet basic eligibility

### 2. Income Threshold

This decision table determines whether a student meets the income threshold criteria:

- **Inputs**:
  - `student.maritalStatus`: The student's marital status
  - `student.age`: The student's age
  - `family.childCount`: The number of children in the family
  - `family.income`: The family's income

- **Outputs**:
  - `incomeThreshold.result`: Whether the student meets the income threshold
  - `incomeThreshold.adjustedThreshold`: The adjusted income threshold based on family circumstances
  - `incomeThreshold.reason`: The reason for not meeting the income threshold

- **Rules**:
  - Different income thresholds apply based on marital status, age, and family size
  - For single students under 25, thresholds increase with family size
  - For single students 25 or older, a fixed threshold applies
  - For married students, thresholds increase with family size

### 3. Document Verification

This decision table determines whether a student has submitted all required documents:

- **Inputs**:
  - `documents.hasIdDocument`: Whether the student has submitted an ID document
  - `documents.hasEnrollmentCertificate`: Whether the student has submitted an enrollment certificate
  - `documents.hasIncomeDocumentation`: Whether the student has submitted income documentation

- **Outputs**:
  - `documentVerification.result`: Whether all required documents have been verified
  - `documentVerification.reason`: List of missing documents

- **Rules**:
  - If all required documents are present, document verification passes
  - If any document is missing, document verification fails and the missing documents are listed

### 4. Priority Categories

This decision table determines a student's priority category and score:

- **Inputs**:
  - Various student attributes related to priority categories (orphan status, disability, etc.)

- **Outputs**:
  - `priorityCategory.result`: The student's priority category
  - `priorityCategory.score`: The student's priority score

- **Rules**:
  - Different priority categories have different scores
  - The highest applicable priority category is assigned
  - If no priority category applies, the category is "NONE" with a score of 0

## Function Node

The function node collects results from all decision tables and makes the final eligibility determination:

```javascript
export const handler = async (input) => {
  // Determine overall eligibility based on all three criteria
  const isEligible = (input.basicEligibility?.result === true) && 
                     (input.incomeThreshold?.result === true) && 
                     (input.documentVerification?.result === true);
  
  // Determine the reason for ineligibility
  let reason2 = (isEligible) ? "Student passes all criteria" : "- ";
  if (!isEligible) {
    if (input.basicEligibility?.result !== true) reason2 = input.basicEligibility?.reason;
    else if (input.incomeThreshold?.result !== true) reason2 = input.incomeThreshold?.reason;
    else if (input.documentVerification?.result !== true) reason2 = input.documentVerification?.reason;
  }
  const reason = reason2;
  const priorityCategory_result = input.priorityCategory?.result
  const priorityCategory_score = input.priorityCategory?.score
  
  return {
    "result": isEligible,
    "reason": reason,
    "priorityCategory_result": priorityCategory_result,
    "priorityCategory_score": priorityCategory_score,
    "input": input.$nodes.Request
  };
};
```

This function:
- Checks if all three criteria (basic eligibility, income threshold, and document verification) are met
- Determines the appropriate reason for ineligibility based on which criterion failed
- Includes the priority category and score in the output
- Returns the original input for reference

## Benefits of This Approach

The parallel decision table approach offers several advantages over traditional decision trees:

1. **Modularity**: Each decision table focuses on a specific aspect of eligibility, making the model easier to understand and maintain

2. **Efficiency**: Parallel processing allows for more efficient evaluation of eligibility criteria

3. **Clarity**: The separation of concerns makes the model easier to reason about and debug

4. **Maintainability**: Changes to one aspect of eligibility can be made without affecting others

5. **Scalability**: New decision tables can be added to handle additional eligibility criteria

## Implementation Details

The implementation in `student_meal_eligibility_updated.json` uses the GoRules Zen engine format, which represents the decision model as a JSON object with nodes and edges. The nodes represent the input, decision tables, function node, and output, while the edges represent the flow of data between them.

## Testing

The model is tested using the `test_student_meal_eligibility_updated.ts` file, which evaluates various scenarios:

1. Eligible student with priority (orphan)
2. Eligible student with no priority
3. Not eligible due to income
4. Not eligible due to missing documents
5. Not eligible due to foreign scholarship

These tests verify that the model correctly determines eligibility based on the input data.

## Conclusion

The student meal eligibility decision model uses a parallel decision table approach rather than traditional decision trees. This approach offers advantages in terms of modularity, efficiency, clarity, maintainability, and scalability. The implementation in `student_meal_eligibility_updated.json` demonstrates how this approach can be used to model complex eligibility rules in a clean, maintainable way.

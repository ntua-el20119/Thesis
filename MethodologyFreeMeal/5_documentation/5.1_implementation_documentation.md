# Implementation Documentation for Student Meal Eligibility System

This document provides comprehensive documentation of the student meal eligibility system implementation, including assumptions, interpretations, and decisions made during the implementation process.

## 1. System Overview

The student meal eligibility system is a rules-based decision system that determines whether a student is eligible for meal benefits based on various criteria defined in the student meal eligibility regulation. The system is implemented using the GoRules Zen engine, which provides a flexible and maintainable way to implement complex decision logic.

### 1.1 Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **Input Node**: Receives the student data, family information, and documentation status.
2. **Decision Tables**: Process different aspects of eligibility in parallel:
   - `basicEligibility`: Checks basic eligibility criteria (active student, eligible institution, no foreign scholarship).
   - `incomeThreshold`: Checks if the family income is below the applicable threshold.
   - `documentVerification`: Checks if all required documents have been submitted.
   - `priorityCategory`: Determines the student's priority category and score.
3. **Function Node**: Collects results from the decision tables and makes the final eligibility determination.
4. **Output Node**: Returns the final eligibility determination.

### 1.2 Decision Flow

The decision flow follows this pattern:

```
Input Node → Decision Tables (in parallel) → Function Node → Output Node
```

This parallel processing approach allows for more efficient evaluation of eligibility criteria and makes the system easier to understand and maintain.

## 2. Assumptions and Interpretations

### 2.1 Definition of "Active Student"

**Assumption**: An "active student" is defined as a student who is currently enrolled in an eligible institution and has not been suspended or expelled.

**Rationale**: The regulation does not explicitly define what constitutes an "active" student. This interpretation aligns with common academic practice and focuses on the student's current enrollment status rather than academic performance or attendance.

**Confidence Level**: Medium (0.7)

**Alternative Interpretations**:
- "Enrolled and attending classes regularly" (Confidence: 0.6)
- "Enrolled and making satisfactory academic progress" (Confidence: 0.5)

### 2.2 Calculation of Family Income

**Assumption**: Family income includes all taxable income of the student's parents or guardians (if the student is under 25 and single) or the student and spouse (if the student is married).

**Rationale**: The regulation defines family income in terms of tax declarations, suggesting that taxable income is the appropriate measure.

**Confidence Level**: High (0.8)

**Alternative Interpretations**:
- "All income including non-taxable benefits" (Confidence: 0.4)
- "Only employment income" (Confidence: 0.3)

### 2.3 Local Residence Adjustment

**Assumption**: The 10% reduction in income thresholds for local residents is applied before determining eligibility, effectively creating a separate set of thresholds for local residents.

**Rationale**: This interpretation aligns with the intent of the regulation to provide additional support to local residents while maintaining a clear and consistent eligibility determination process.

**Confidence Level**: Medium (0.7)

**Alternative Interpretations**:
- "Apply the reduction only when funding is limited" (Confidence: 0.4)
- "Apply the reduction as a tiebreaker for priority categories" (Confidence: 0.3)

### 2.4 Unemployment Exception

**Assumption**: The unemployment exception takes precedence over the income threshold, meaning that a student or family with unemployment benefits is eligible regardless of their income.

**Rationale**: This interpretation aligns with the intent of the regulation to provide support to students affected by unemployment, recognizing that reported income may not reflect the current financial situation.

**Confidence Level**: High (0.8)

**Alternative Interpretations**:
- "Apply the exception only when the unemployment started after the income was reported" (Confidence: 0.5)
- "Apply the exception only when the unemployment is expected to be long-term" (Confidence: 0.4)

### 2.5 Priority Categories

**Assumption**: Priority categories are mutually exclusive, and a student is assigned to the highest applicable priority category.

**Rationale**: This interpretation provides a clear and consistent way to prioritize students when funding is limited, avoiding the complexity of handling multiple overlapping priority categories.

**Confidence Level**: Medium (0.6)

**Alternative Interpretations**:
- "Students can belong to multiple priority categories with cumulative scores" (Confidence: 0.5)
- "Priority categories are applied sequentially with specific rules for each category" (Confidence: 0.4)

## 3. Implementation Decisions

### 3.1 Parallel Decision Tables

**Decision**: Implement eligibility criteria using parallel decision tables rather than a single, complex decision tree.

**Rationale**: This approach offers several advantages:
- **Modularity**: Each decision table focuses on a specific aspect of eligibility, making the model easier to understand and maintain.
- **Efficiency**: Parallel processing allows for more efficient evaluation of eligibility criteria.
- **Clarity**: The separation of concerns makes the model easier to reason about and debug.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one aspect of eligibility can be made without affecting others.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single decision tree: Rejected due to complexity and maintainability concerns.
- Sequential decision tables: Rejected due to efficiency concerns and unnecessary dependencies.

### 3.2 Function Node for Final Decision

**Decision**: Use a function node to combine the results of the decision tables and make the final eligibility determination.

**Rationale**: This approach allows for more complex logic in combining the results of the decision tables, such as handling the unemployment exception and providing detailed reasons for ineligibility.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Additional decision table: Rejected due to limitations in expressing complex logic.
- Multiple function nodes: Rejected due to unnecessary complexity.

### 3.3 Parameterized Interpretations

**Decision**: Implement configurable parameters for ambiguous elements, such as the definition of "active student" and the application of the local residence adjustment.

**Rationale**: This approach allows for policy adjustments without code changes, making the system more flexible and adaptable to changing interpretations.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Hardcoded interpretations: Rejected due to lack of flexibility.
- Multiple implementation versions: Rejected due to maintenance overhead.

### 3.4 Confidence Scoring

**Decision**: Assign confidence scores to interpretations and decisions to indicate the level of certainty.

**Rationale**: This approach provides transparency about the reliability of decisions and helps identify cases that may require human review.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Binary certainty (certain/uncertain): Rejected due to lack of nuance.
- No confidence scoring: Rejected due to lack of transparency.

# Student Meal Eligibility System: Public Transparency Documentation

This document provides clear and accessible information about the student meal eligibility system, including how decisions are made, what factors are considered, and how to understand and challenge decisions.

## 1. Overview of the Student Meal Eligibility Program

The Student Meal Eligibility Program provides meal benefits to eligible students at participating educational institutions. This document explains how the automated system determines eligibility for these benefits.

### 1.1 Purpose of the Program

The program aims to ensure that students have access to nutritious meals, regardless of their financial circumstances. By providing meal benefits to eligible students, the program supports:

- Equal access to education
- Student health and well-being
- Reduced financial burden on students and families
- Improved academic performance

### 1.2 Legal Basis

The program is established under the Student Meal Eligibility Regulation, which defines the eligibility criteria, application process, and operational rules for the program.

## 2. How Eligibility Decisions Are Made

The eligibility determination process involves several steps, each evaluating different aspects of a student's situation.

### 2.1 Basic Eligibility Criteria

To be eligible for meal benefits, a student must meet all of the following basic criteria:

1. **Active Student Status**: The student must be actively enrolled in an eligible educational institution.
2. **Eligible Institution**: The student must be enrolled in a recognized public or private educational institution that participates in the program.
3. **No Foreign Scholarship**: The student must not be receiving a foreign scholarship that includes meal benefits.

### 2.2 Income Criteria

If a student meets the basic eligibility criteria, the system then evaluates their family income against applicable thresholds:

#### For Single Students Under 25:
- One-child family: €45,000
- Two-child family: €48,000
- Three-child family: €51,000
- More than three children: €51,000 + €3,000 per additional child

#### For Single Students 25 or Older:
- €30,000 regardless of family size

#### For Married Students:
- No children: €60,000
- One child: €63,000
- Two children: €66,000
- More than two children: €66,000 + €3,000 per additional child

#### Special Adjustments:
- **Local Residence**: Students who are local residents receive a 10% reduction in the applicable income threshold (making it easier to qualify).
- **Unemployment Exception**: Income criteria are waived if the student or a relevant family member is receiving unemployment benefits.

### 2.3 Documentation Requirements

To be eligible, students must submit all required documentation:

1. **Identification Document**: A valid government-issued ID.
2. **Enrollment Certificate**: Proof of current enrollment at an eligible institution.
3. **Income Documentation**: Tax declarations or other proof of family income.
4. **Special Category Documentation**: Additional documentation for special categories (e.g., unemployment benefits, disability certification).

### 2.4 Priority Categories

When funding is limited, students are prioritized based on the following categories (in order of priority):

1. Orphans
2. Children of terrorism victims
3. Students with serious illness
4. Students with family members with disabilities
5. Single parents or children of single parents
6. Children of unmarried mothers
7. Students from large families
8. Students from multi-child families
9. Students with siblings who are also students

## 3. Understanding Your Eligibility Decision

### 3.1 Decision Explanation

When you receive an eligibility decision, it includes:

- **Overall Result**: Whether you are eligible for meal benefits.
- **Reason**: If you are not eligible, the specific reason for ineligibility.
- **Priority Category**: If applicable, your priority category and score.

### 3.2 Common Reasons for Ineligibility

Common reasons for ineligibility include:

- **Not an active student**: You are not currently enrolled or your enrollment status is inactive.
- **Institution not eligible**: Your educational institution does not participate in the program.
- **Foreign scholarship**: You are receiving a foreign scholarship that includes meal benefits.
- **Income above threshold**: Your family income exceeds the applicable threshold.
- **Missing documentation**: You have not submitted all required documentation.

### 3.3 Confidence Indicators

Some decisions may include a confidence indicator, which reflects the system's level of certainty in the decision:

- **High Confidence**: The decision is based on clear criteria and complete information.
- **Medium Confidence**: The decision involves some interpretation or incomplete information.
- **Low Confidence**: The decision involves significant interpretation or uncertainty.

Decisions with low confidence are automatically flagged for human review.

## 4. Alternative Outcomes

In some cases, different interpretations of the rules could lead to different outcomes. This section explains some of these scenarios.

### 4.1 Definition of "Active Student"

The system defines an "active student" as a student who is currently enrolled and not suspended or expelled. However, alternative interpretations could include:

- **Regular Attendance**: A student who is enrolled and attending classes regularly.
- **Academic Progress**: A student who is enrolled and making satisfactory academic progress.

If your eligibility was affected by this interpretation and you believe a different interpretation should apply, you may appeal the decision.

### 4.2 Local Residence Adjustment

The system applies a 10% reduction in income thresholds for local residents before determining eligibility. Alternative approaches could include:

- **Limited Funding Only**: Applying the reduction only when funding is limited.
- **Tiebreaker**: Using local residence as a tiebreaker for priority categories.

If you believe a different approach should apply to your case, you may appeal the decision.

### 4.3 Unemployment Exception

The system waives income criteria when the student or a relevant family member is receiving unemployment benefits. Alternative interpretations could include:

- **Recent Unemployment**: Applying the exception only when unemployment started after the income was reported.
- **Long-term Unemployment**: Applying the exception only for long-term unemployment.

If your eligibility was affected by this interpretation and you believe a different interpretation should apply, you may appeal the decision.

## 5. Challenging a Decision

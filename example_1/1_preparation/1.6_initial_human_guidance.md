# Initial Human Guidance: Student Meal Eligibility Regulation

This document outlines the initial human guidance for the LLM-assisted Rules as Code implementation of the student meal eligibility regulation.

## Project Scope and Objectives

### Scope

The project aims to analyze and formalize the rules governing student meal eligibility in Greek higher education institutions as defined in the regulation. The scope includes:

- Eligibility criteria for free meals
- Income thresholds and adjustments
- Priority categories for limited resources
- Documentation requirements
- Verification procedures
- Administrative processes

The scope does not include:

- Implementation of the physical meal distribution system
- Integration with specific university information systems
- Financial management of meal provision
- Nutritional guidelines or meal planning

### Objectives

1. **Formalization**: Transform the legal text into a structured, machine-readable format that preserves the legal meaning and intent.
2. **Consistency**: Identify and resolve inconsistencies, ambiguities, and gaps in the regulation.
3. **Transparency**: Ensure that the implementation provides clear explanations for eligibility decisions.
4. **Adaptability**: Design the system to accommodate potential future changes to eligibility criteria or thresholds.
5. **Efficiency**: Streamline the application and verification process to reduce administrative burden.

## Critical Legal Concepts

The following legal concepts require special attention during implementation:

### 1. Active Student Status

The concept of "ενεργοί φοιτητές" (active students) is fundamental to eligibility but lacks explicit definition in the regulation. Based on common practice in Greek higher education, this should be interpreted as:

- Currently enrolled in a recognized program
- Not exceeding the normal duration of studies plus a defined grace period (typically n/2 semesters, where n is the normal duration)
- Not on formal leave of absence (except for cases like military service)

### 2. Family Income Calculation

The regulation defines family income broadly to include all sources (taxable, tax-exempt, and specially taxed). Implementation should:

- Consider the total household income as reported to tax authorities
- Include imputed income based on assets and living expenses
- Account for special cases like agricultural income or foreign income

### 3. Priority System

The priority system for limited resources is complex, with multiple overlapping categories. Implementation should:

- Establish a clear hierarchy among priority categories
- Define procedures for cases where a student falls into multiple priority categories
- Create transparent allocation mechanisms when resources are insufficient

### 4. Documentation Verification

The regulation requires extensive documentation but doesn't specify verification methods. Implementation should:

- Define procedures for validating document authenticity
- Establish protocols for handling incomplete or inconsistent documentation
- Create processes for periodic re-verification

## Validation Criteria

LLM outputs should be validated against the following criteria:

### 1. Legal Accuracy

- Correctly captures all eligibility criteria from the regulation
- Preserves the legal meaning and intent of each provision
- Accurately represents relationships between different provisions

### 2. Completeness

- Addresses all sections of the regulation
- Covers all special cases and exceptions
- Identifies and addresses gaps in the regulation

### 3. Consistency

- Resolves contradictions in a principled manner
- Applies consistent interpretations across similar provisions
- Maintains logical coherence across the implementation

### 4. Explainability

- Provides clear explanations for eligibility decisions
- Traces decisions back to specific provisions in the regulation
- Explains how ambiguities or contradictions were resolved

## Inconsistency Framework

The following principles should be applied to resolve inconsistencies in the regulation:

### 1. Lex Specialis (Specific Over General)

When a specific provision conflicts with a general one, the specific provision takes precedence. For example:

- The unemployment exception (Article 1, Section 5) is more specific than the general income requirements (Article 1, Section 2) and should take precedence.
- Special documentation requirements for specific categories (Article 5, Section 1, items θ-μ) are more specific than general documentation requirements.

### 2. Purposive Interpretation

When provisions are ambiguous or contradictory, interpret them in light of the regulation's purpose: to provide meals to students in need while ensuring fair distribution of limited resources. This suggests:

- Interpreting ambiguities in favor of student eligibility when resources are sufficient
- Prioritizing the most vulnerable students when resources are limited
- Minimizing administrative burden while maintaining program integrity

### 3. Systemic Coherence

Interpret provisions to maintain the coherence of the regulatory system as a whole:

- Interpret undefined terms consistently across the regulation
- Resolve contradictions to minimize disruption to the overall system
- Ensure that procedural provisions support substantive rights

### 4. Hierarchy of Provisions

When contradictions cannot be resolved through other principles, apply the following hierarchy:

1. Explicit eligibility criteria (Article 1, Sections 1-3)
2. Special exceptions (Article 1, Section 5)
3. Adjustments and modifications (Article 1, Section 4)
4. Priority categories (Article 1, Section 9)
5. Procedural requirements (Articles 5-6)

## Uncertainty Parameters

The implementation should include explicit confidence thresholds and escalation criteria:

### 1. Confidence Thresholds

| Confidence Level | Threshold | Action |
|------------------|-----------|--------|
| High | ≥ 0.9 | Automated decision without human review |
| Medium | 0.7 - 0.9 | Automated decision with selective human review |
| Low | 0.5 - 0.7 | Flagged for human review before decision |
| Insufficient | < 0.5 | Automatic escalation to human decision-maker |

### 2. Escalation Criteria

The following cases should be escalated for human review regardless of confidence level:

- First-time applications in newly identified edge cases
- Cases involving multiple or conflicting priority categories
- Cases where documentation is incomplete but alternative evidence is provided
- Cases where the calculated income is within 5% of the threshold
- Cases involving complex family structures not explicitly addressed in the regulation

### 3. Confidence Calculation Factors

Confidence levels should be calculated based on:

- Clarity of the applicable legal provisions
- Completeness and consistency of documentation
- Presence of special circumstances or edge cases
- Proximity to threshold values
- Historical precedent for similar cases

This framework provides guidance for implementing the student meal eligibility regulation in a way that is legally accurate, consistent, and transparent while acknowledging and addressing areas of uncertainty.

# Text Preprocessing for Student Meal Eligibility Regulation

This document outlines the text preprocessing steps applied to the student meal eligibility regulation as part of the LLM-assisted Rules as Code methodology.

## Approach

The text preprocessing phase involves four key steps:

1. **Segmentation**: Breaking the legal text into logical sections
2. **Normalization**: Standardizing terminology across sections
3. **Key Section Identification**: Focusing on the most important sections for implementation
4. **Inconsistency Scanning**: Identifying potential contradictions, ambiguities, and gaps

## Segmentation Process

The regulation was segmented into logical sections based on:
- Article boundaries
- Paragraph boundaries within articles
- Numbered/lettered lists within paragraphs

The segmentation preserves the hierarchical structure of the regulation while creating manageable units for analysis.

## Normalization Approach

Terminology normalization focused on:
- Standardizing references to students (e.g., "φοιτητές", "σπουδαστές")
- Consistent representation of monetary values
- Uniform formatting of institutional names
- Consistent terminology for eligibility criteria

## Key Section Identification Criteria

Sections were prioritized based on:
- Direct relevance to eligibility determination
- Procedural importance for implementation
- Complexity of rules contained
- Frequency of reference by other sections

## Inconsistency Scanning Methodology

The scanning process looked for:
- Contradictory conditions or requirements
- Undefined or ambiguous terms
- Circular references
- Gaps in procedural flows
- Overlapping or redundant provisions

## Results Summary

The preprocessing results are documented in the following files:
- `1.2_segmented_text.md`: The regulation broken into logical sections
- `1.3_normalized_terminology.md`: Standardized terminology across the regulation
- `1.4_key_sections.md`: Identification of the most important sections
- `1.5_inconsistency_scan.md`: Potential contradictions, ambiguities, and gaps

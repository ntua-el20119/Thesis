# Rule Formalization: Student Meal Eligibility Regulation

This document presents the formalized rules extracted from the student meal eligibility regulation, structured in a format suitable for implementation.

## Rule Formalization Approach

The rules have been formalized using a structured format that includes:

1. **Rule ID**: A unique identifier for each rule
2. **Description**: A brief description of the rule's purpose
3. **Inputs**: The data inputs required for the rule
4. **Logic**: The formal logic of the rule, expressed in a structured format
5. **Outputs**: The results produced by the rule
6. **Dependencies**: Other rules that this rule depends on
7. **Confidence**: An assessment of the clarity and completeness of the rule in the regulation

## 1. Eligibility Rules

### Rule E1: Basic Student Eligibility

- `student.previousDegrees`: Previous degrees held by the student

**Logic**:
```
function determineBasicEligibility(student) {
    if (student.enrollmentStatus !== "ENROLLED_IN_GREEK_HEI") {
        return {
            eligible: false,
            reason: "NOT_ENROLLED_IN_GREEK_HEI"
        };
    }
    
    if (!["FIRST", "SECOND", "THIRD"].includes(student.studyCycle)) {
        return {
            eligible: false,
            reason: "INVALID_STUDY_CYCLE"
        };
    }
    
    if (student.activeStatus !== "ACTIVE") {

            eligible: false,
            reason: "NOT_ACTIVE_STUDENT"
        };
    }
    
    // Check if student already has equivalent degree
    const hasEquivalentDegree = student.previousDegrees.some(
        degree => degree.level === student.studyCycle
    );
    
    if (hasEquivalentDegree) {
        return {
            eligible: false,

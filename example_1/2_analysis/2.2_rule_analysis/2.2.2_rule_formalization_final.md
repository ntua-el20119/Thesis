# Rule Formalization: Student Meal Eligibility Regulation (Final)

This document completes the formalization of rules extracted from the student meal eligibility regulation.

## 6. Operational Rules (Continued)

### Rule O8: Cafeteria Outsourcing

**Rule ID**: O8_CAFETERIA_OUTSOURCING

**Description**: Defines whether cafeteria operation may be outsourced.

**Inputs**:
- `cafeteria.responsibleEntity`: The entity responsible for cafeteria operation

**Logic**:
```
function determineCafeteriaOutsourcing(cafeteria) {
    if (!["STUDENT_CLUB", "INSTITUTION"].includes(cafeteria.responsibleEntity)) {
        return {
            mayOutsource: false,
            reason: "NO_RESPONSIBLE_ENTITY"
        };
    }
    
    return {
        mayOutsource: true,
        procurementRules: "PUBLIC_PROCUREMENT",
        reason: "RESPONSIBLE_ENTITY_MAY_OUTSOURCE"
    };
}
```

**Outputs**:
- `mayOutsource`: Boolean indicating whether cafeteria operation may be outsourced
- `procurementRules`: The rules governing procurement (if applicable)
- `reason`: String explaining the determination

**Dependencies**:
- Rule O7 (Cafeteria Operation Responsibility)

**Confidence**: High (0.9) - The outsourcing permission is clearly stated in the regulation

## Rule Execution Sequence

Based on the dependencies, the rules should be executed in the following sequence:

1. **Eligibility Determination**:
   - Execute Rules E1-E5 to determine if the student meets basic eligibility criteria
   - If eligible, proceed to income assessment

2. **Income Assessment**:
   - Execute Rules I1-I7 to determine applicable income thresholds and adjustments
   - Execute Rule I8 to check for unemployment exception
   - Determine if student meets income requirements

3. **Priority Assessment** (if funding is insufficient):
   - Execute Rule P1 to determine if priority system should be activated
   - If activated, execute Rules P2-P9 to determine student's priority categories

4. **Documentation Requirements**:
   - Execute Rules D1-D10 to determine required documentation based on eligibility, income, and priority claims

5. **Application Processing**:
   - Execute Rule PR1 to determine application submission requirements
   - Execute Rule PR2 to verify documentation
   - Execute Rule PR3 to issue special ID if eligible
   - Execute Rules PR4-PR6 for ID management (renewal, loss reporting, usage)

6. **Meal Service Operation** (independent of student eligibility):
   - Execute Rules O1-O2 to determine meal provision schedule and content
   - Execute Rules O3-O6 to determine meal program development process
   - Execute Rules O7-O8 to determine cafeteria operation responsibility and outsourcing

This execution sequence ensures that rules are evaluated in a logical order that respects their dependencies and produces consistent results.

## Confidence Assessment

The overall confidence in the formalized rules is high (0.85 average), with most rules having clear definitions in the regulation. The main areas of uncertainty are:

1. **Definition of "active student"** (Rule E1): The regulation does not explicitly define what constitutes an "active" student, requiring interpretation.

2. **Definition of "large family" and "multi-child family"** (Rules P2-P3): The regulation references external legislation for these definitions.

3. **Definition of "serious illness"** (Rule P8): The regulation references external legislation for this definition.

4. **Complex family structures** (Rules I1-I3): The regulation does not explicitly address how to handle complex family structures like divorced parents or blended families.

5. **Renewal process for special ID** (Rule PR4): The regulation mentions renewal but does not specify the process in detail.

These areas of uncertainty should be addressed through the uncertainty modeling approach outlined in the previous document, with appropriate confidence scoring and escalation pathways for cases that fall into these ambiguous categories.

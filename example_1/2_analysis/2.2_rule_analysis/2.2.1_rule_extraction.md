## Rule Dependencies

The rules have the following dependencies:

1. **Eligibility Rules (E1-E5)**: These are the entry point for determining if a student is eligible for free meals. They are independent of other rules.

2. **Income Rules (I1-I8)**: These depend on the eligibility rules, as they only apply to students who meet the basic eligibility criteria. Within this category:
   - I2-I3 depend on I1 (adjustments to the basic threshold)
   - I5 depends on I4 (adjustments to the married student threshold)
   - I7 applies to the adjusted thresholds from I2, I3, I5, or I6
   - I8 can override the outcomes of I1-I7

3. **Priority Rules (P1-P9)**: These depend on the eligibility and income rules, as they only apply to eligible students when funding is insufficient. P1 is the trigger for applying P2-P9.

4. **Documentation Rules (D1-D10)**: These depend on the eligibility, income, and priority rules, as the required documentation varies based on which criteria and priorities a student claims.

5. **Procedural Rules (PR1-PR6)**: These depend on the documentation rules, as they govern the process of application, verification, and ID issuance.

6. **Operational Rules (O1-O8)**: These are largely independent of the other rule categories, as they govern the meal service operation regardless of individual student eligibility.

This rule extraction provides the foundation for formalizing the decision logic in the student meal eligibility regulation.

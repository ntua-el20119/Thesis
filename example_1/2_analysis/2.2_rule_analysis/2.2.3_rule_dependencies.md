## 2. Dependency Types

The dependencies between rules can be categorized into the following types:

1. **Prerequisite**: A rule that must be evaluated before another rule can be applied. For example, eligibility rules (E1-E5) are prerequisites for income rules (I1-I8).

2. **Input**: A rule that provides input data for another rule. For example, I1 provides the basic income threshold that is modified by I2 and I3.

3. **Modifier**: A rule that modifies the output of another rule. For example, I2 modifies the income threshold established by I1.

4. **Override**: A rule that can override the outcome of another rule. For example, I8 can override the income requirements established by I1-I7.

5. **Trigger**: A rule that activates another rule under certain conditions. For example, P1 triggers the priority rules P2-P9 when funding is insufficient.

6. **Conditional**: A rule that is only applied under certain conditions. For example, D2 is only applied if the student claims student sibling adjustment or priority.

7. **Sequential**: A rule that must be applied in sequence after another rule. For example, PR3 follows PR2 in the application processing sequence.

8. **Exclusive**: Rules that are mutually exclusive. For example, O3 and O4 are exclusive - either one or the other applies depending on whether the institution has a Student Club.

9. **Constraint**: A rule that constrains the application of another rule. For example, PR6 constrains the use of the special ID issued through PR3.

10. **Independent**: A rule that operates independently of other rules. For example, O1 and O2 define meal provision schedules and content independently of eligibility rules.

11. **Circular**: A dependency relationship where two rules depend on each other. For example, E5 depends on income rules, which in turn depend on eligibility rules.

## 3. Dependency Clusters

The rules can be grouped into the following dependency clusters:

### Cluster 1: Eligibility Determination

## 4. Potential Conflicts

The analysis identified the following potential conflicts between rules:

### 4.1. Circular Dependency in Foreign Scholarship Eligibility

**Conflict**: Rule E5 (Foreign Scholarship Eligibility) depends on income rules (I1-I8), which in turn depend on eligibility rules (E1-E5).

**Impact**: This circular dependency could lead to inconsistent eligibility determinations for foreign scholarship recipients.

**Resolution**: Implement a two-phase evaluation for foreign scholarship recipients:
1. First, evaluate basic eligibility criteria (undergraduate status, scholarship status)
2. Then, evaluate income requirements if applicable

### 4.2. Overlapping Priority Categories

**Conflict**: A student may qualify for multiple priority categories (P2-P9), but the regulation does not specify how to handle such cases.

**Impact**: Without clear prioritization, students with multiple priority categories might be treated inconsistently.

**Resolution**: Establish a hierarchy of priority categories based on the order they appear in the regulation, or implement a point system that assigns weights to different categories.

### 4.3. Local Residence Adjustment vs. Income Thresholds

**Conflict**: Rule I7 (Local Residence Adjustment) reduces income thresholds by 10% for local residents, which could conflict with the intent to provide support to students with financial need.

**Impact**: Local students near the threshold might be unfairly excluded due to the adjustment.

**Resolution**: Apply the local residence adjustment after determining eligibility based on unadjusted thresholds, treating it as a prioritization factor rather than an eligibility criterion.

### 4.4. Unemployment Exception vs. Income Documentation

**Conflict**: Rule I8 (Unemployment Exception) exempts students from income criteria, but Rule D3 (Income Documentation) still requires income documentation for all students claiming income-based eligibility.

**Impact**: Students exempt from income criteria might still be required to provide unnecessary income documentation.

**Resolution**: Modify Rule D3 to exclude students who qualify for the unemployment exception, requiring only unemployment benefit documentation (D4) in such cases.

## 5. Potential Gaps

The analysis identified the following potential gaps in the rule system:

### 5.1. Definition of "Active Student"

**Gap**: The regulation uses the term "active student" as a fundamental eligibility criterion but does not define it.

**Impact**: Without a clear definition, institutions might apply inconsistent criteria for determining active status.

**Resolution**: Define "active student" based on common practice in Greek higher education, such as current enrollment, registration for the current academic year, and not exceeding the normal duration of studies plus a grace period.

### 5.2. Appeal Process

**Gap**: The regulation does not specify any appeal process for students whose applications are rejected.

**Impact**: Students who believe their applications were incorrectly rejected have no formal recourse.

**Resolution**: Implement an appeal process that allows students to contest decisions and provide additional information if their application is denied.

### 5.3. Mid-Year Changes in Circumstances

**Gap**: The regulation does not address how to handle changes in a student's circumstances during the academic year.

**Impact**: Students whose circumstances change (e.g., family income, marital status) might be unable to update their eligibility status.

**Resolution**: Implement a process for students to report significant changes in circumstances and update their eligibility status accordingly.

### 5.4. Digital Submission and Verification

**Gap**: The regulation assumes physical document submission and verification but doesn't address digital alternatives.

**Impact**: Institutions might be unable to implement efficient digital application and verification processes.

**Resolution**: Extend the documentation rules to accommodate digital submission and verification methods, with appropriate security measures.

### 5.5. Priority Ordering

**Gap**: While the regulation lists priority categories, it does not specify how to order students within each category when resources are limited.

**Impact**: Institutions might apply inconsistent criteria for prioritizing students within categories.

**Resolution**: Establish clear ordering criteria within each priority category, such as family income, distance from home, or academic performance.

## 6. Implementation Considerations

Based on the dependency analysis, the following considerations should guide the implementation:

### 6.1. Rule Execution Order

Implement the rules in the following order to respect dependencies:

1. Eligibility Rules (E1-E5)
2. Income Rules (I1-I8)
3. Priority Rules (P1-P9)
4. Documentation Rules (D1-D10)
5. Application Processing Rules (PR1-PR6)
6. Meal Service Operation Rules (O1-O8)

### 6.2. Modular Implementation

Implement each rule cluster as a separate module to facilitate maintenance and updates:

- Eligibility Module
- Income Assessment Module
- Priority Assessment Module
- Documentation Module
- Application Processing Module
- Meal Service Operation Module

### 6.3. Configuration Parameters

Implement the following as configurable parameters to accommodate institutional variations and policy changes:

- Income thresholds and adjustments
- Definition of "active student"
- Documentation validity periods
- Application deadlines
- Priority category weights

### 6.4. Error Handling

Implement robust error handling for the following scenarios:

- Missing or incomplete documentation
- Contradictory information
- Edge cases not explicitly addressed in the regulation
- Circular dependencies

### 6.5. Audit Trail

Maintain a comprehensive audit trail that records:

- All rule evaluations and outcomes
- Interpretations applied to ambiguous provisions
- Decisions made in edge cases
- Changes in eligibility status over time

### 6.6. Human Review Integration

Integrate human review points for:

- Cases with low confidence scores
- First occurrences of edge cases
- Appeals and exceptions
- Cases with multiple or conflicting priority categories

## 7. Conclusion

The rule dependencies analysis reveals a well-structured but complex system of rules governing student meal eligibility. The identified conflicts and gaps can be addressed through careful implementation that respects the dependencies between rules while providing clear interpretations for ambiguous provisions.

The modular implementation approach, combined with configuration parameters and robust error handling, will ensure that the system can accommodate institutional variations and policy changes while maintaining consistency and transparency in eligibility determinations.

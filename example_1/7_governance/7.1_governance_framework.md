# Governance Framework for Student Meal Eligibility System

This document outlines the governance framework for the student meal eligibility system, establishing clear authority, accountability, and oversight mechanisms for the system's operation and evolution.

## 1. Governance Principles

The governance of the student meal eligibility system is guided by the following principles:

### 3.3 Emergency Decision Protocol

In emergency situations requiring immediate decisions:

1. The highest available authority makes an interim decision
2. The decision is documented with rationale
3. The decision is reviewed by the appropriate authority within 2 business days
4. A permanent decision is made and documented

## 4. Interpretation Management

### 4.1 Interpretation Registry

All interpretations of the regulation are recorded in an Interpretation Registry, which includes:

- The specific provision being interpreted
- The approved interpretation
- The rationale for the interpretation
- Alternative interpretations considered
- The confidence level in the interpretation
- The authority who approved the interpretation
- The date of approval
- The review date

### 4.2 Interpretation Process

The process for establishing new interpretations is as follows:

1. **Identification**: An ambiguity or unclear provision is identified
2. **Analysis**: Legal and domain experts analyze the provision
3. **Proposal**: A proposed interpretation is developed with alternatives
4. **Review**: The appropriate authority reviews the proposal
5. **Approval**: The interpretation is approved and documented
6. **Implementation**: The interpretation is implemented in the system
7. **Communication**: The interpretation is communicated to stakeholders
8. **Review**: The interpretation is reviewed periodically

### 4.3 Interpretation Principles

When interpreting the regulation, the following principles apply (in order of priority):

1. **Lex specialis**: More specific rules override general ones
2. **Legislative intent**: Consider the purpose behind the legislation
3. **Lex posterior**: More recent rules override older ones
4. **Lex superior**: Higher-authority rules override lower-authority ones

### 4.4 Confidence Levels

Interpretations are assigned confidence levels based on the following criteria:

| Confidence Level | Score | Description | Review Frequency | Human Review |
|------------------|-------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| High | 0.8-1.0 | Clear basis in text or established precedent | Annual | Not required |
| Medium | 0.6-0.7 | Reasonable inference from text or context | Semi-annual | Selective |
